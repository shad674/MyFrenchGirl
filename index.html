          <p>
            "Love" the fact that we have a lot in common! I love the way we can
            relate to many things while also learning from each other's unique
            perspectives. Coming from different cultures, we know we'll face a
            lot of challenges in the way, but I know we can overcome them ü§ù

            "You" are an amazing person!! two months have flown by, but they've
            been filled with so much joy and happiness. I would love to see
            ourselves reach 1 year, 2 years, 5 years... and still grow to love
            each other more. So lets fill up more joyful memories moving
            forward, okay?‚ù§Ô∏è
